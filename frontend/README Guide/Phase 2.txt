# 🧩 Phase 2 – Project Design and Tables

*A structured guide to plan your system design, database, and architecture before you start coding.*

---

## 🎯 Purpose of Phase 2

This phase is where your **project idea takes structural form** — you’ll design:

* How your project is organized (modules & users)
* What data it handles (tables, entities, relationships)
* How users will interact with it (UI/UX)
* How the backend and frontend connect

You’re basically **creating the blueprint** of your system — like an architect’s plan before the building begins.

---

## 🧠 Step-by-Step Structure of Phase 2

---

### **1. System Overview**

Start by giving a short summary of how your system works overall — mention the main modules or user types and their interactions.

> **Example (Project Management System):**
> The system consists of two main users — **Admin** and **Team Member**.
>
> * The **Admin** can create projects, assign tasks, and view progress reports.
> * The **Team Member** can view assigned tasks, update status, and communicate with others.
>   Both users interact through a web interface with real-time updates managed through a backend database.

---

### **2. Module Identification**

List all modules or subparts of your project and describe what each one does.

> **Example Modules:**
>
> 1. **User Module:** Handles registration, login, and role-based access.
> 2. **Project Module:** Allows creation, editing, and deletion of projects.
> 3. **Task Module:** Enables adding, updating, and tracking of individual tasks.
> 4. **Report Module:** Generates progress and completion summaries.
> 5. **Notification Module:** Sends alerts about new tasks or deadlines.

💡 *Tip:* Keep modules independent but connected logically — each should handle one main responsibility.

---

### **3. User Roles and Permissions**

Define what each type of user can and cannot do.

| User Type            | Permissions                                  |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Admin**            | Create & manage users, projects, and reports |
| **Team Member**      | View assigned tasks, update task status      |
| **Guest (optional)** | View project overview only                   |

---

### **4. Database Design**

Database design is the *heart* of this phase. Plan what data you need to store and how tables are related.

#### **a) Identify Entities (Tables)**

Start by listing all logical data groups.

> Example for Project Management:
>
> * `users`
> * `projects`
> * `tasks`
> * `comments`
> * `notifications`

---

#### **b) Define Attributes (Columns)**

For each table, define the columns, data types, and constraints.

> **Example Database Schema**

**users**

| Field      | Type                   | Description          |
| ---------- | ---------------------- | -------------------- |
| id         | INT (PK)               | Unique user ID       |
| name       | VARCHAR(100)           | User’s full name     |
| email      | VARCHAR(100)           | Login email (unique) |
| password   | VARCHAR(255)           | Encrypted password   |
| role       | ENUM('admin','member') | User role            |
| created_at | DATETIME               | Registration time    |

**projects**

| Field       | Type                                  | Description           |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| id          | INT (PK)                              | Project ID            |
| title       | VARCHAR(150)                          | Project title         |
| description | TEXT                                  | Brief project summary |
| created_by  | INT (FK → users.id)                   | Who created it        |
| start_date  | DATE                                  | Project start date    |
| end_date    | DATE                                  | Deadline              |
| status      | ENUM('pending','ongoing','completed') | Project progress      |

**tasks**

| Field       | Type                              | Description      |
| ----------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| id          | INT (PK)                          | Task ID          |
| project_id  | INT (FK → projects.id)            | Related project  |
| assigned_to | INT (FK → users.id)               | Assigned member  |
| title       | VARCHAR(150)                      | Task name        |
| details     | TEXT                              | Task description |
| deadline    | DATE                              | Task due date    |
| progress    | ENUM('todo','in-progress','done') | Task status      |

---

#### **c) Relationships (ER Diagram)**

Design an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) to visually show connections between tables.

> **Example Relationships (in words):**
>
> * One **User** can create many **Projects**.
> * One **Project** can have many **Tasks**.
> * One **Task** belongs to exactly one **User** and one **Project**.
> * Comments belong to both a **Task** and a **User**.

*(You can draw this using [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net), Lucidchart, or Figma.)*

---

### **5. UI/UX Design (Wireframes or Layouts)**

Show how your application will look and feel.
You can sketch by hand or use tools like Figma / Canva / Balsamiq.

> **Example Screens (Web):**

1. **Login Page** – User authentication
2. **Dashboard** – List of all projects with progress indicators
3. **Project Detail** – Tasks, members, and comments
4. **Task Edit Page** – Update task status
5. **Report Page** – Charts showing completed vs. pending tasks

💡 *Tip:*
Keep the interface minimal, responsive, and consistent (use the same color scheme, fonts, and layout spacing).

---

### **6. Process Design (Data Flow Diagrams - DFDs)**

Represent how data moves through your system.

#### **DFD Level 0 (Context Diagram)**

* Shows the entire system as one process.
* Displays interactions between system and users.

> *Example:*
> User → [Project Management System] → Database

#### **DFD Level 1 (Detailed Flow)**

* Breaks down system processes into smaller sub-processes.

> *Example:*
> User → Login → Dashboard → Project CRUD → Task CRUD → Reports

---

### **7. UML Diagrams (Optional but Strongly Recommended)**

Advanced students can add these to make documentation professional:

* **Use Case Diagram** – Interactions between users and the system
* **Activity Diagram** – Flow of actions
* **Class Diagram** – Object structure (for OOP-based systems)

---

### **8. Example: Design Summary for “Project Management System”**

Here’s a short design sample that shows how everything ties together:

> **Modules:** User, Project, Task, Report
> **Users:** Admin, Team Member
> **Database Tables:** users, projects, tasks, comments
> **Flow:**
>
> 1. User logs in → system authenticates from `users` table.
> 2. Admin creates a project → entry in `projects`.
> 3. Tasks are assigned → added to `tasks`.
> 4. Members update progress → reflected in dashboard.
> 5. Reports are generated by aggregating task data.

## 🧰 Tools Recommended for Phase 2

| Purpose         | Tools                                |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Database design | draw.io, Lucidchart, MySQL Workbench |
| UI/UX           | Figma, Canva, Balsamiq               |
| ERD / UML       | StarUML, Creately                    |
| Collaboration   | GitHub, Trello, Notion               |
| Backend Testing | Postman                              |

---

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

* ❌ Designing tables without relationships
* ❌ Forgetting to include constraints like primary/foreign keys
* ❌ Mixing UI design with backend logic too early
* ❌ Overcomplicating database structure
* ❌ Ignoring scalability (think ahead for future modules)

---

## ✅ Deliverables for Phase 2

* [ ] List of modules and users
* [ ] Database schema (with fields & relationships)
* [ ] ER diagram
* [ ] UI sketches / wireframes
* [ ] Data flow diagram (DFD)
* [ ] Optional UML diagrams

---

### 🎓 Summary

By the end of Phase 2, your **blueprint should be ready**.
You should have a *clear picture* of how your application will look, how data flows, and how modules interact.

Once the design is approved, you’ll move to **Phase 3 – Development**, where you’ll bring everything to life using your chosen tech stack.
