# 📄 Phase 4 – Project Report & Final Documentation

*A complete guide to writing, formatting, and compiling your final project report professionally.*

---

## 🎯 Purpose of Phase 4

The **final report** documents everything you’ve done — from planning to design, development, and testing.
It serves as:

* A **record of your full project lifecycle**,
* A **technical document** to evaluate your understanding,
* And your **official submission** for grading and future reference.

By the end of this phase, you should have:
✅ A complete written project report (printed + digital)
✅ Screenshots, diagrams, and references
✅ Source code and executable files ready for viva/demo

---

## 🧩 Structure of the Project Report

Below is a **standard structure** (used by most MCA colleges, including CUSAT and similar universities).
Each section has a short explanation and example content to guide you.

---

### 🏫 **Front Matter**

These pages come before the main content.

1. **Title Page**

   * Project Title

   * Submitted to (college name, department)

   * Your Name, Register Number

   * Guide Name

   * College logo and month/year

   > Example:
   >
   > ```
   > PROJECT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM  
   > A Project Report Submitted to  
   > COCHIN UNIVERSITY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY  
   > In Partial Fulfilment of the Requirements for the Degree of  
   > MASTER OF COMPUTER APPLICATIONS
