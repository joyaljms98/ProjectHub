To do :



Make the sync between teams and teacher work, 
add the fuction to add project files.

Get messages and hints about how to do the project.





now instead of the notification icon in the student dashboard, ()
<button id="notification-btn" class="absolute top-8 right-8 z-50 p-2 rounded-lg bg-card-light dark:bg-card-dark shadow-md text-text-light dark:text-text-dark hover:bg-gray-100 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 transition-all duration-300 ease-in-out">
<span class="material-icons-outlined">notifications</span>
</button> 

can you convert that to a sticky note and remove the sticky note from the bottom of the dashboard that already exist. make the new sticky note be a floating one that just intakes the typed text and keeps it in the users sticky note in the mongodb. it will have a save button to save the text. but user cant add new sticky note, only edit that existing one note which will be available throughout. no need for any security or anything,. Also when the user touches anywhere else the sticky note hides back into the icon.

also add the exact same thing for the teacher. infact try to combine the codes for both sucnh that it can work in both dashboards with the same code because the functionalities are the same.
